Welcome to higgs2fourlep's documentation!
==========================================

**higgs2fourlep** is a Python package for analysing the Higgs boson decaying to four leptons final state.
It pulls data from the ATLAS Open Data set, and provides the tools for plotting the kinematic distributions
of the decay and measuring the Higgs mass.
A Machine Learning algorithm is implemented for enhancing the signal purity over background.

The project makes use of the package `pyROOT` and depends on `matplotlib`, `munch`, `PyYAML`, `sklearn` and `XGBoost`.
